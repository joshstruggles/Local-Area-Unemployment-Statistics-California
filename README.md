# Local-Area-Unemployment-Statistics-California

## Dataset 

__['Local Area Unemployment Statistics'](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/local-area-unemployment-statistics-laus)__  current as of March, 2023. <br> 

__['DFA256 - Food Stamp Program Participation and Benefit Issuance Report'](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/dfa256-food-stamp-program-participation-and-benefit-issuance-report)__ current as of May 16, 2023. 
<br>

## Hypothesis 

According to the article  by Elen Theodossiou and Steven F. Hipple, __['Unemployment remains high in 2010'](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2011/03/art1full.pdf)__, __"Workers with less education continued to experience a
substantially higher unemployment rate than did better educated members of the labor force."__(4) <br> 

The pandemic in 2020 created massive gaps in employment opportunity internationally but historically California has ranked highly in unemployment, at the time of this project (March 2023 was the most recent data) California's unemployment rate is 45th of 51 entries. <br>

__Our goal then is to put Theodossiou and Hipple's claim to the test.__ We will see if California cities experienced a historic rate of unemployment higher than 2020's pandemic and if so, explore higher education data from the __[United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/)__. <br> 

## Business Problem

According to a recent article posted on what could be considered America's most uncelebrated holiday __['National Skilled Trades Day'](https://gvwire.com/2023/05/02/on-national-skilled-trades-day-americas-labor-shortage-looms/)__, there is a high need for skilled labor in the job market. Specifically, these are blue collar jobs in the trades (carpentry, HVAC, iron work, sheet metal, and aviation). 
<br> 

Are there then groups in our data on counties and unemployment rate that may shed light on a potential group of candidates for a proposal for an EDD sponsored version of job training? That is the goal of our project. 
<br>

## Method of Analysis 

Based on California city data, where cities experienced historic unemployment rates __higher__ than the pandemic, we will explore level of education and create a baseline for analysis. <br> 

For cities that experience higher unemployment rates outside of the expected (2020's pandemic), we will graph unemployment rate, education level, and predictive model for future recommendations. <br>
