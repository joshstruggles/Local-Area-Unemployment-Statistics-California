## Business Problem

According to a recent article posted on what could be considered America's most uncelebrated holiday __['National Skilled Trades Day'](https://gvwire.com/2023/05/02/on-national-skilled-trades-day-americas-labor-shortage-looms/)__, there is a high need for skilled labor in the job market. Specifically, these are blue collar jobs in the trades (carpentry, HVAC, iron work, sheet metal, and aviation). There is a growing sentiment in the United States that there aren't people willing to work, but according to the article by Elen  Theodossiou and Steven F. Hipple, __['Unemployment remains high in 2010'](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2011/03/art1full.pdf)__, __"Workers with less education continued to experience a substantially higher unemployment rate than did better educated members of the labor force."__(4)
<br> 

Taking into consideration that ALL the jobs highlighted in the article __['National Skilled Trades Day'](https://gvwire.com/2023/05/02/on-national-skilled-trades-day-americas-labor-shortage-looms/)__ require some kind of certificate of completion from a trade school or on the job training, it is our intention to look at counties in California with high unemployment rates and attempt to identify members of specific business sectors that the EDD (State of California Employment Development Department) can recruit for training in these high demand jobs. 
<br>

Are there then groups in our data on counties and unemployment rate that may shed light on a potential group of candidates for a proposal for an EDD sponsored version of job training? That is the goal of our project. 
<br>

## Method of Analysis 

Based on California city data, where cities experienced historic unemployment rates __higher__ than the pandemic, we will explore level of education and create a baseline for analysis. <br> 

For cities that experience higher unemployment rates outside of the expected (2020's pandemic), we will graph unemployment rate, education level, and predictive model for future recommendations. <br> 

## Where would the $ potentially come from to fund this endeavor?
